    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <p>
      The <em>cottage garden</em> is a distinct style of garden that uses an
      informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible
      plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be
      traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's
      England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more
      structured and rigorously maintained <u>English estate gardens</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern
      descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some
      fruit trees.
